### 👨‍💻 About Me

- ✍️ I love to **draw** and **write stories**. The world's a lot more fun in my head.
- 🔐 I'm passionate about **Cybersecurity** and part of **CSeC IITB**.
- 🧮 Linear Algebra? I can walk in Tensors, I can talk in Tensors, I can laugh in Tensors. 
- 💻 I maintain servers from old laptops because they're **fun**. I'm also currently interested in getting them to work as central nodes for distributed computing
- 🐧 Proud member of the **Linux gang**. From Ubuntu to Kali to, after a lot of more exploration, Mint.
- ❤️ A huge fan of **Open Source** and hope to **contribute soon**.

### 🚀 Currently Working On

- **CUDA**: So many projects fall into your research if you can parallelize your algorithms
- **Computational Engineering (Continuum Mechanics)**: Learning to use high-performance computing for solid and fluid mechanics
- **Fluid Physics**: Pair it with CFD, and this rabbit hole will be the death of me.
- **Julia**: Once again, GPU computing is what draws me to it. One of the few languages that runs natively on the GPU.
