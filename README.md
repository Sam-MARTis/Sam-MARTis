### üë®‚Äçüíª About Me
 I love reading stories and fiction. A hugeeeeeee fan of Warhammer - The Emperor Protects!
 As I navigate the hedonic treadmill, you'll find me with a new obsession every week. From Percolation theory to Thermoacoustics to Photovoltaics. 
 If I could describe myself in one quote, it'd be this: If everything is under control, you're going too slow.
 I swear I'm funny, though the number of dad jokes I force upon others might cause my friends to disagree ü´Ä

### üöÄ Currently Working On

- **CUDA**: So many projects fall into your research if you can parallelise your algorithms. 
- **Computational Physics**: Learning to use high-performance computing for solving physics stuff. Love it.
- **Fluid Physics**: Pair it with CFD, and this rabbit hole will be the death of me.
- **Julia**: Once again, GPU computing is what draws me to it. One of the few languages that runs natively on the GPU.
- **Thermoacoustics**: Heat => Sound => Stuff => More Heat => More Sound => Boom
- **Thermophotovoltaics**: Light + Heat => üîã
